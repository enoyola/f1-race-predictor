```

## 🧮 Prediction Methodology

The predictor offers two prediction modes:

### Statistical Mode (Default)

Uses a weighted scoring model that combines multiple factors to generate predictions:

### Scoring Factors

1. **🏆 Championship Position (25%)**: Current driver standings in the championship
2. **📈 Recent Form (20%)**: Performance in the last 5 races
3. **🏁 Team Performance (20%)**: Constructor championship standings
4. **⏱️ Qualifying Position (20%)**: Grid position from qualifying session
5. **🗺️ Circuit History (15%)**: Historical performance at the specific circuit

### Confidence Calculation

```
Final Score = (0.25 × Championship) + (0.20 × Form) + (0.20 × Team) + 
              (0.20 × Qualifying) + (0.15 × Circuit)

Confidence = Final Score × Data Completeness Factor
```

The confidence score is adjusted based on data availability. For example:
- If qualifying hasn't happened yet, confidence is reduced
- If circuit history is limited, confidence is adjusted accordingly
- New drivers or teams receive lower confidence scores

### Machine Learning Mode

Uses a trained Random Forest classifier that learns optimal feature weights from historical F1 data (2020-2024):

- **Model**: Random Forest with 100 estimators
- **Training Data**: 5 years of historical race results (~500 samples)
- **Features**: Same 5 factors as statistical mode
- **Advantage**: Automatically discovers optimal weights and non-linear patterns
- **Accuracy**: ~99.7% cross-validation accuracy on training data

To use ML mode, first train the model:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

Then run predictions with the `--ml` flag:

```bash
python -m f1_predictor.cli --ml
```

**Feature Importance (Learned from Data):**
- Championship Position: 59.8%
- Qualifying Position: 22.0%
- Recent Form: 18.3%
- Team Performance: ~0%
- Circuit History: ~0%

The ML model discovered that qualifying position is more important than the statistical model assumes!

### 🌐 Data Sources

- **Primary API**: [Jolpica F1 API](https://api.jolpi.ca/ergast) - A modern replacement for the discontinued Ergast API
- **Data Coverage**: Historical F1 data from 1950 to present
- **Update Frequency**: Real-time during race weekends

### 💾 Caching Strategy

To improve performance and reduce API load, the predictor caches data with the following TTL (Time To Live) values:

| Data Type | Cache Duration |
|-----------|----------------|
| Season results | 24 hours |
| Driver/Constructor standings | 6 hours |
| Qualifying results | 1 hour |
| Circuit history | 7 days |

Cache files are stored in the `.f1_cache/` directory.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### ❌ "Network error: Unable to connect to API"

**Cause**: Cannot reach the Jolpica F1 API

**Solutions**:
- Check your internet connection
- Verify the API is accessible: `curl https://api.jolpi.ca/ergast/f1/current/next.json`
- Try again later if the API is temporarily down
- Use cached data if available (remove `--no-cache` flag)

#### ⚠️ "No qualifying data available yet"

**Cause**: Qualifying session hasn't occurred or data isn't published yet

**Solutions**:
- This is normal before qualifying happens
- The predictor will generate predictions using available data
- Confidence scores will be adjusted to reflect missing data
- Run again after qualifying completes for updated predictions

#### "Cache directory permission denied"

**Cause**: Cannot write to `.f1_cache/` directory

**Solutions**:
- Check directory permissions: `ls -la .f1_cache`
- Create directory manually: `mkdir .f1_cache`
- Run with `--no-cache` to disable caching

#### "Prediction timeout"

**Cause**: API requests taking too long

**Solutions**:
- Check your network speed
- Try using cached data (remove `--no-cache` flag)
- The predictor has a 10-second timeout per request with retry logic

### Data Quality Issues

If predictions seem inaccurate:

1. **Check data freshness**: Use `--no-cache` to fetch latest data
2. **Verify race weekend timing**: Predictions are most accurate after qualifying
3. **New season limitations**: Early season predictions have less historical data
4. **New drivers/teams**: Limited data results in lower confidence scores

### Getting Help

If you encounter persistent issues:

1. Check that you're using Python 3.8 or higher: `python --version`
2. Verify all dependencies are installed: `pip list`
3. Try running with `--verbose` for detailed output
4. Clear cache and try again: `rm -rf .f1_cache`
